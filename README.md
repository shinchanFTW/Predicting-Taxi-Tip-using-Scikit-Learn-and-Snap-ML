**ðŸš– Taxi Fare Prediction Example by IBM**

This repository contains an example project, inspired by IBM, for predicting taxi fares using machine learning. The goal is to demonstrate how to preprocess data, engineer features, and build a predictive model to estimate taxi fares based on various factors such as distance, location, and time of day.


**âœ¨ Key Features**

Data Preprocessing: Clean and transform raw taxi trip data into meaningful features.
Feature Engineering: Create new features such as distance, pickup/drop-off regions, and trip time.
Model Building: Train a machine learning model to predict taxi fares accurately.
Evaluation: Measure the performance of the model using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².
Deployment Ready: The project is structured to help deploy the model using IBM Watson Studio or any preferred environment.
